Here is the brand new launch for the geography quiz: Globe Trotter Quiz.

This is the first interactive quiz the company has launched, announcing themselves to the world. Globe Trotter Quiz is a passion project, birthed from the creators love of travel and adventure. Having been fortunate enough to travel the world, the creator still longs and obsesses over memories and places visited, and loves to to be reminded about all travel-related things. Moreso, the creator has a desire to share that love with a greater audience: like-minded people and travellers, keen quizzers, families and students - all are welcome to challenge themselves! The creator is excited to launch their quiz and hope to attract more and more players from accross the world.

### Quiz premis and rules:

A classic geogrpahy quiz, suitable to single or multiple players of all ages. The Globe Trotter Quiz is a multiple-choice quiz where the user is presented with 10 questions, each correct answer worth 2500 air miles. The goal? To answer 10 correct answers totalling a whopping 25,000 air miles - about the same distance it is to travel around the globe! See if you can travel to the top of the High Scores list!



The quiz will clearly display information for new and returning customers including the creators contact info via social media links. The website is fully responsible on a range of devices - from hand-held devices to larger screens such as monitors or even TVs. This is to ensure that as many eyes as possible can play the quiz and enjoy this journey.



The quiz can be played by one person or as many as would like to partake. There are rumours of a more child-friendly version to follow with additions of sound and pictures and even theme changes.

The quiz is a simple geogrpahy/travel quiz, with questions focused on the players knowledge of this subject.
The quiz generates 1 question at a time, with 4 multiple choice options as answers.
The player clicks on the buttons/answers and the quiz and a visual prompt is given via the colour change to signify the players selection was correct (green) or incorrect (red).
The quiz automatically displayes the next question after a short delay.
There are a total of 10 questions to answer.
The end screen for the quiz gives the total amount of Air Miles amassed.
A player can enter their name to save their high score to the quiz's database.
The player accumilates air miles as a scoring system, with each correct answer awarded 5000 miles.

## Design
Once the user goals and the projects intentions were set out, the next step was to design the aesthetic aspects of the Globe Trotter quiz.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were drawn using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) at the beginning of the project. They were referenced throughout the design and building of the quiz. Following are a series of images showing the Globe Trotter Quiz on the three main screen sizes: desktop, tablet and mobile. Every major section of the quiz is also included.

#### Colour Palette
- Colour is vital for the design of this quiz.

- The primary colours used on the Globe Trotter Quiz are ash gray (#ced4c6), puce (#c6878f) and white (#fff).
There is a hint of navy purple (#5b507a) found to better contrast the text with the hero image on the index.html home page.
The text colour is predominantly a dark black (#000) to ensure a greater contrast between the mellow, pastel colour palette and background.
There is some text content in white - especially when the background is a darker colour or shade.



<img src="assets/readme-images/palette.png">

- The ash gray (#ced4c6) colour came from using [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/). This colour picker tool was used to pick the colour from the company logo used on the Bakes by No√©mie [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bakesbynoemie/) page.

- It was decided early on in the design stage that this would be the background colour. A pastel colour that was fairly neutral and in no way distracting. It provided a perfect base to layer other colours and content on top of. It is both a visually appealing design and also satisfies the importance of providing an accessible website with high contrast.

<img src="assets/readme-images/contrast.png">

- The [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ced4c6-c6878f-5b507a) website was then used to help choose colours that would compliment the background colour. This helped set-up the vision of creating an aesthetically pleasing website and of course balance everything nicely. The white and black were added to further help with contrast and readability.

#### Images
- The use of photography is vital in creating allure and desire, especially for a bakery. Customers are drawn by what they see. The photographs used are large, light/bright, colourful and hope to entice customers into visiting the shop and purchasing the baked goods.

- It was vital for the theme to be clear and obvious. There are a few reasons for this - recognizable and memorable game so people recall and return to it, which will draw more eyes to the game.
Therefore, it was important that the background image provided along with the CSS styling and colour palette etc. that the game was travel related. The background image provided a great colour scheme and theme which also provided clear contrast and highlighted the actural game area from the background itself. The following image was used.

#### Font
-  The website uses the Poppins font. It seems to be a very popular option amongst youtubers and provides that clean, clear style without compromising on readability. This is available for free via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and imported via CSS. Sans Serif is used as a secondary option in case of failure to import.  font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
- A more stylistic font was initially considered, but due to the readability it was opted to go for a very clean, clear and readable font.


<img src="assets/readme-images/desktop-col-index.html.png">

## Accessibility
Extremely important aspect.
-   Semantic design.
-   The use of alt to describe images and other content.
-   Aria-labelledby to link sections of each webpage together.
-   Colour and contrast considerations and testing.
-   Adding labels to forms.

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes - from 320px upwards to larger desktops reaching 1200px and more.

## Interactive Elements

-   Following is a list of all interactive elements of the Globe Trotter Quiz.

#### Quiz Logo

As shown on the images below, the quiz logo and title is very clear and bright. The centerpiece, always there and clickable. It shows off the quiz nicely, it's obviously related to geogrpahy and serves as a constant reminder to the user about where they are and what they are playing. The logo itself is a clickable link (a cursor appears when hovering over), and returns the user back to the home page at any time. 

<img src="assets/readme-images/logo-click.png">


#### Toggle Menu Elements

Listed are the main features of the main menu of the quiz. The user simply clicks to show or hide the buttons to display info or return back to the main menu.

- How to Play

<img src="assets/readme-images/how-to-container.png">

- Contact

Each icon for the social media links turn gold when the user hovers over them to highlight the focused icon.

<img src="assets/readme-images/contact-container.png">
<img src="assets/readme-images/contact-container-hover.png">

- High Score

<img src="assets/readme-images/highscore-container.png">

#### Buttons

- Almost every button is styled to look the same. A clean and clear button to make for user readabilty and speed, paramount to elite quizzing.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button.png">

- The colours simply invert when a cursor hovers over them. A simple visual indicator and keeping in line with the colour palette.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-hover.png">

- The few exception to the rule is the High Scores button (and mention the disabled button). Due to the nature of this button and it's significance, it was decided to style this differently with a golden (#) hue/ . This is pure bragging righs and to entice the players to compete for the highest score. it will be big factor for returning players.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-highscore.png">

- The Save button is set as disabled as a default. Once the user inputs their name, the button returns to a normal state, just like the others.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-disabled.png">

- gold (rgb(255,210,0)) indicates a correct answer

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-correct.png">

- red(rgb(255,0,0)) indicates an incorrect answer

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-incorrect.png">

#### Input

- The 'Enter your name' input field has a very basic style applied. IF the user chooses not to enter their name, then the Save button remains disabled and the user will not be able to save their score to the High Score section.

<img src="assets/readme-images/input.png">

#### Progress Bar

- The progress bar indicates the progress made by the user via the golden colour-fill and plane image. Every correct answer adds 10% to the progress bar - with the user's aim to reach 100%, a total of 10/10 correct answers.

### Further Testing

-   Testing was predominantly made using Google Chrome's own developer tools and 'Inspect Mode', although testing was done sporadically on alternative browsers with each major addition to the website e.g new content, style updates and responsive changes via keyframes.
-   Console.log() function was used for JavaScript code development.
-   All interactive elements of the quiz were tested. Button functions, clicking, hiding/showing content, user input, links and general flow of quiz. Bugs were fixed as they arose.
-   Testing that the score updated correcttly, incrementing on correct answers only and progressbar progression to reflect this. The same process was done for incorrect answers and various combinations of correct and incorrect answers and users input. The final score was also checked against the in-game score for accuracy and again when submitting to the High Score area.
-   The quiz was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Opera browsers and ran efficiently and consistently on each one. The quiz looked and operated as intended.
-   The quiz was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad & iPhoneX.
-   Feedback from friends and family, testing the quiz with no prior instruction or expectations. Adjustments were made if necessary to satisfy the [User Targets](#as-a-new-user).

### Bug Fixes
Bug fixes were predominantly completed in real-time as soon as any issues arose. This was to ensure the project would continue developing smoothly without serious, unmanagable bugs arising later that could drastically reduce development time or the layout and functioning of the quiz.

-   As seen from the style.css file, there is a lot of custom CSS. Media queries were used at different breakpoints - although time consuming, it was vital to invest time into this to ensure the quiz was functioning correctly on various displays to enure a major [User Targets](#as-a-new-user) was met. Some JavaScript tweaks were also implemented to alter the class width at different stages of the quiz e.g. the main menu, quiz itself or the end.

-   The main containers (see style.css classes .game-area and .container ) would either overlap or completely hide the quiz title and logo. The Globe Trotter Quiz title and logo should be on display at all times no matter what seciton of the quiz the user was viewing, so obviously this bug was very undesirable. This was bug was fixed in a few ways:
    - media queries, as explained above.
    - through adding a margin-top to push the container down and clear from the title and logo.
    - custom JavaScript code to alter specific classes.

-   Added rel-"noopener" to external links opening in new tabs for securirty purposes.

### Known Bugs

-   The background image (maps.jpg) repeats slightly towards the very bottom of the Surface Pro 7 (912px x 1368px) device.

## Credits

### Code
-   At the early stages of the development, the [How to Make a Quiz App using HTML CSS Javascript - Vanilla Javascript Project for Beginners Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY&list=FLoLMoJL7IfiYl8F3sN_CEqQ&index=16) tutorial was followed and the code was used as the basis of the quiz. Original code was later added alongside that found in the YouTube video to suit the quiz. Code tweaks were made to suit this quiz, pre-determined code edited or removed along with adjustments and restyling to the majority of the CSS found in the credited video. Upon further searching, it seems that [Build a Quiz App - Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u98ROZjBWy8&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx) and that playlist of videos may be what the YouTube video I had followed to begin with was also inpired by.

- The API aspect of the quiz was introduced thanks to the [Build a Quiz App (11) - Fetch API to Load Questions API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aKOQn2NPFs&list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx&index=12) tutorial, to which edits were then made.

-   The ability to toggle (show and hide) content via the How To Play, Contact and High Score buttons on the main menu screen came from W3Sschools documentation found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_hide_show.asp), and a separate sournce [here](https://sebhastian.com/javascript-show-hide-div-onclick-toggle/) which was then edited to suit the project, along with additional customization.

-   This README.md document was based on Code Institute's [SampleREADME](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/SampleREADME/blob/master/README.md). The template was used as a guide, then filled with content related to this quiz. The Bakes by Noemie [README.md](https://github.com/rhysmoggs/ms1-bakes-by-noemie/blob/main/README.md) file - the developers personal MS1 submission for the Code Institute course - was also used and then edited to suit this project.
