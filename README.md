[View the live project here.](https://rhysmoggs.github.io/ms2-quiz/)

Here is the brand new launch for the quiz game, Globe Trotters Quiz.

This is the first game the company has launched, with hopes to announce itself to the world. Globe Trotters is a passion project, birthed from the creators love of travel and geography. Having been fortunate to travel the world, the creator still obsesses to be reminded and share that love of travel and adventure with a great audience, either like-minded travellers, keen quizzers, randomers or students. The company expects to increase brand awareness and attract more players. The game will clearly display information for new and returning customers including the creator's contact info via social media links. The website is fully responsible on a range of hand-held devices to larger screens. This is to ensure that as many eyes as possible can play the game and enjoy this journey.

The game is a simple geogrpahy/travel quiz, with questions focused on the players knowledge of this subject.
The game generates 1 question a time, with 4 multiple choice options as answers.
The player clicks on the buttons/answers and the game and a visual prompt is given via the colour change to signify the players selection was correct (green) or incorrect (red).
The game automatically displayes the next question after a short delay.
There are a total of 10 questions to answer.
The end screen for the game gives the total amount of Air Miles amassed.
A player can enter their name to save their high score to the game's database.
The player accumilates air miles as a scoring system, with each correct answer awarded 5000 miles.

## Design
Once the user goals and the projects intentions were set out, the next step was to design the aesthetic aspects of the Globe Trotters game.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were drawn using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) at the beginning of the project. They were referenced throughout the design and building of the hame. Following are a series of images showing the Globe Trotters game on the three main screen sizes: desktop, tablet and mobile. Every major section of the game is also included.

#### Colour Palette
- Equally as important in the baking industry - especially with decorative products, colour is vital for the design of this website.

- The primary colours used on the Bakes by Noémie website are ash gray (#ced4c6), puce (#c6878f) and white (#fff).
There is a hint of navy purple (#5b507a) found to better contrast the text with the hero image on the index.html home page.
The text colour is predominantly a dark black (#000) to ensure a greater contrast between the mellow, pastel colour palette and background.
There is some text content in white - especially when the background is a darker colour or shade.



<img src="assets/readme-images/palette.png">

- The ash gray (#ced4c6) colour came from using [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/). This colour picker tool was used to pick the colour from the company logo used on the Bakes by Noémie [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bakesbynoemie/) page.

- It was decided early on in the design stage that this would be the background colour. A pastel colour that was fairly neutral and in no way distracting. It provided a perfect base to layer other colours and content on top of. It is both a visually appealing design and also satisfies the importance of providing an accessible website with high contrast.

<img src="assets/readme-images/contrast.png">

- The [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ced4c6-c6878f-5b507a) website was then used to help choose colours that would compliment the background colour. This helped set-up the vision of creating an aesthetically pleasing website and of course balance everything nicely. The white and black were added to further help with contrast and readability.

#### Images
- The use of photography is vital in creating allure and desire, especially for a bakery. Customers are drawn by what they see. The photographs used are large, light/bright, colourful and hope to entice customers into visiting the shop and purchasing the baked goods.

- It was vital for the theme to be clear and obvious. There are a few reasons for this - recognizable and memorable game so people recall and return to it, which will draw more eyes to the game.
Therefore, it was important that the background image provided along with the CSS styling and colour palette etc. that the game was travel related. The background image provided a great colour scheme and theme which also provided clear contrast and highlighted the actural game area from the background itself. The following image was used.

#### Font
-  The website uses the Poppins font. It seems to be a very popular option amongst youtubers and provides that clean, clear style without compromising on readability. This is available for free via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and imported via CSS. Sans Serif is used as a secondary option in case of failure to import.  font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
- A more stylistic font was initially considered, but due to the readability it was opted to go for a very clean, clear and readable font.

## Accessibility
Extremely important aspect.
-   Semantic design.
-   The use of alt to describe images and other content.
-   Aria-labelledby to link sections of each webpage together.
-   Colour and contrast considerations and testing.
-   Adding labels to forms.

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes - from 320px upwards to larger desktops reaching 1200px and more.

## Interactive Elements

-   There are many interactive elements to the game.

#### Navbar

As shown on the images below, the nav bar has a consistent and clean style. it is completely responsive, with a toggle menu appearing for smaller screen sizes of 767px and under. This was based on Boostraps own nav [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/), which I then styled myself and altered classes. The company's name is always visible, which is very important for consistency and brand exposure and familiarity. Having the company's name present as a logo, also allows the user to instinctively click on it to return to the home page.

#### Modal

- The modal appears when the "Show me more" link on the offer banner just below the navbar. Functions on mobile, tablet, laptop and larger desktops.

<img src="assets/readme-images/modal.png">

#### Buttons

- ALmost every button is styled to look the same.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button.png">

- The colours simply invert when a cursor hovers over them. A simple visual indicator and keeping in line with the colour palette.

<img src="assets/readme-images/button-hover.png">

- The exception to the rule is the High Scores button. Due to the nature of this button and it's significane, it was decided to style differently with a golden (#) hue/ . This is to entice the players to keep playing, and a big factor in returning players.

#### Instagram link

- The Instagram link appears centrally on both the index.html and shop.html. webpages. It serves as a visual reminder to check the company's social media account. This aims to drive up visitors and curiosity.

<img src="assets/readme-images/instagram.png">

#### Newsletter

- The Newsletter found on the index.html page requires validation before accepting the user input.

<img src="assets/readme-images/newsletter.png">

- When user successfully complies with prompted validation, they are met with the following screen.
- This screen is taken from the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) template, and is used just for the purpose of showing a successful action.

<img src="assets/readme-images/ci-form.png">

#### Message Us

- As with the Newsletter feature seen above, the Message Us form on the contact.html page also requires validation before the user can submit their data.

<img src="assets/readme-images/messageus.png">

- As with the Newsletter feature, the user will be met with the same Code Institute webpage informing them that the data was input successfully.

<img src="assets/readme-images/ci-form2.png">

#### Google Maps

- [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) was used to provide an interactive map on the Contact Us page. It was embedded as an iframe and then styled further.

### Further Testing

-   Testing was predominantly made using Google Chrome's own developer tools and 'Inspect Mode', although testing was done sporadically on alternative browsers with each major addition to the website e.g. new content or responsive changes via keyframes.
-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Opera browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad & iPhoneX.

-   I had feedback throughout from Noémie herself, who gave guidance and a critical eye throughout.

### Bug Fixes

-   As seen from the style.css file, there is a lot of custom css. I manually adjusted each screen size and the layout, often times changing the display from flex/flexbox to inline on smaller screens - then adjusting the width of the containers.
-   There was an issue on the iPad where the navbar would push the white background and links down to cover the 'offer banner' below. This was due to my custom padding settings overriding bootstraps own classes. This was resolved by changing it's property to "width: max-content" on a media query from 768px and up.

-   There was an issue on smaller screens where the footer social media links - via Font Awesome icons - were stacking untidily and creating padding issues. This was resolved by creating a media query to reduce the icon sizes at the relevant breakpoint for smaller screens.

-   Added rel-"noopener" to external links opening in new tabs for securirty purposes.

### Known Bugs

-   The navbar menu links are slightly off-centre, although the navbar is responsive and moves with the width of the screen.
-   The footer can rise up when there is a lack of content on a webpage. This is something to consider for future content adjustments.

## Credits

### Code
-   At the early stages of the development, [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) code was used to create responsive containers throughout the website. I would use their principal code for building the layout via containers, rows and columns then add my own content, elements or adjust their pre-determined classes.
Later on in the development I removed the majority of the bootstrap code and built custom sections, containers and content with custom css. This decision was made after viewing [MS1 Preparation and CSS Positioning by Suzy Bennett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4bhJ4u29Do)'s YouTube video.

- The navbar keeps Bootstrap's own code, although I have added my own css to it to fit the website layout and responsiveness. I used some of Bootstraps own classes to further customize their default navbar.

### Inspiration

-   The idea of the offer banner found just under the navbar was taken from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)'s 'Whiskey Drop' banner although I styled and created the html aspects myself.

-   Youtube links here and code credit, content etc

### Content

-   The hero image on the index.html webpage is owned by Noémie Fradette of Bakes by Noémie.
